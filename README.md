# GetYourGuide Assessment

## Getting Started

These are rough guidelines on how to get this running locally on your computer.

### Prerequisites

You will need node and npm accessible in your cli. You can get those here: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installing

Within this repository directory, run
```
npm i
```

Once things have finished installing, run the following command to get a local server started:
```
npm run dev
```

Then visit `localhost:8080` and you're good to go!


## Building "production-ready" files

Running `npm run build` will create a `dist/` directory with an `index.html`, `bundle.js`, and `bundle.js.map/` (the source map).

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - module bundler
* [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) - parses CSS and adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - transpiler for es6
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - a scripting language that is compiled into CSS
* [lodash](https://lodash.com/) - JavaScript utility library

* [Chai](http://www.chaijs.com/) - JavaScript tests!

* [sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) - for testing with spies and watchers!

## Things I would do with more time:

* Sleep! Exercise! Eat well.
